[![On Merge](https://github.com/eliasnogueira/credit-api/actions/workflows/merge-main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eliasnogueira/credit-api/actions/workflows/merge-main.yml)

This project was created to start the initial steps with test automation for a REST API using RestAssured.
It's a combination of the following projects to facilitate the test automation:

* [credit-restriction-api](https://github.com/eliasnogueira/credit-restriction-api)
* [credit-simulation-api](https://github.com/eliasnogueira/credit-simulation-api)

# Required software

* Java JDK 23+
    * you can change the `java.version` property in the `pom.xml` file to `17` as this project is not using any specific
      Java 23 feature
